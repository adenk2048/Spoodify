# Spoodify
If used, this would be SO illegal! I sure am happy that no one would have any funny ideas downloading this software...

HOW TO USE:
1. run these commands in your terminal (python must be installed):
   pip install pygame
   pip install mutagen
   pip install yt-dlp

2. Run downloader to download every MP3 you need. It will probably take a long time.
3. Create a playlist (example: ABBA.txt). every file should be a .txt file type.
   In this playlist, put the name of every .mp3 file you want (example: for "DancingQueen.mp3", put DancingQueen)
   NOTE: do not put spaces in your song name! I was too lazy to work around .split()
5. Run music_player and enjoy your music
6. IMPORTANT: If you want your song history to be saved, you should close the music player before closing your shell.

HOW TO CHECK SPOODIFY WRAPPED
1. Run wrapped.py
2. It will tell you the cumulative time you spent listening to all your songs!
